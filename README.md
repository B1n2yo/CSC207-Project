# CSC207-Project

Problem Domain: 
For our project, we will attempt to create a nutrition
application that will allow users to enter a desired daily caloric and
nutritional goal. The application will then provide sets of breakfast, lunch and
dinner recipes that will fit with their goals. Things such as a desired calorie
count, protein/carb/fat intake, and other nutritional goals will be taken into
account when choosing the recipes.

Some potential features:
- A way to save favourite recipes.
- Viewing each meal's nutritional information.
- Being able to set dietary restrictions.
- Saving preset settings for easy switching between calorie surplus/deficits.

An example call using hopscotch with the API is in the file adwadawd.png.
