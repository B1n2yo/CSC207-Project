# CSC207-Project

https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api

Problem Domain: For our project, we will attempt to create a nutrition
application that will allow users to enter a desired daily caloric and
nutritional goal. The application will then provide sets of breakfast, lunch and
dinner recipes that will fit with their goals. Things such as a desired calorie
count, protein/carb/fat intake, and other nutritional goals will be taken into
account when choosing the recipes. Some potential features includes a way to
save recipes and viewing both each meal's nutritional information and the day's
total info.
